Quitting Alcohol in London,"Advice needed; I’m a fairly social person, I have a lot of friends, different friendship groups from old workplaces, school etc. every social event revolves around drinking beers, always has, always will - it’s never just one, it’s always a lot. I’m done with it, I can’t face the anxiety, depression, embarrassment that comes along with it. How am I supposed to navigate this? It’ll change my life if I stop, will I be bored? I still want to see my friends but can I really just sit in a pub for 7 hours drinking Soda water and lime? I’m 34 now and my friends have been my friends my whole life, I hope they’ll understand. I’ve grown up in London and going to the pub is just something that is done, it’s normal, it’s almost strange not to. I need some words of encouragement, please.

Edit: I should maybe clarify, on average I’m invited out for a drink maybe 2 times a week (popular right!) I don’t always go, but when I do it’s a lot of beers. So when I say it’ll change my life, it really will affect my social situation. I also have a girlfriend who I upset regularly through my drinking.","Quitting Alcohol in London Advice needed; I’m a fairly social person, I have a lot of friends, different friendship groups from old workplaces, school etc. every social event revolves around drinking beers, always has, always will - it’s never just one, it’s always a lot.

I argue with drivers all the time. How likely is it that someone is going to punch me - or worse?,"I’m asking as a pedestrian not a cyclist or a motorist.

I’ve been arguing with drivers for ten years in London but my partner is convinced one of these days someone is going to beat me up or stab me… what do you think?

The two main types of argument I have are either with drivers at pelican crossings, for example, they drive to the crossing at full speed, I’m on the pavement waiting for them to stop, they throw their hands up in there and chat to me (annoyed that I didn’t walk in front of their car going a 40mph), I tell him what I think.

The other example is when people are idling their car / van outside my house / kids school and I politely ask them to turn engine off. To be fair this example almost never results in an argument, people just switch their engine off and say sorry.

My argument is generally speaking people aren’t violent in London, especially to strangers, especially in the daytime. So sometimes arguments get quite heated, but nothing has ever happened. What do you think?","I argue with drivers all the time. How likely is it that someone is going to punch me - or worse? I’m asking as a pedestrian not a cyclist or a motorist.

Vomiting bug after ball pit at the Balloon Museum,"I visited the Balloon Museum on Friday with my family and some friends. 

For those who haven’t come across it it’s a series of art installation using balloons. Art wise it’s fluffy nonsense but it is very instagrammable, which I feel is the point. 

Yesterday my wife, our friend, our baby and I got varying degrees of ill, exhausted, vomiting, diarrhoea etc. The common denominator was the ball pit. The others we went with who didn’t get in the pit are fine. 

I’ve since looked up ball pits and of course they are filthy and full of germs and bacteria. Has anyone experienced this? ","Vomiting bug after ball pit at the Balloon Museum I visited the Balloon Museum on Friday with my family and some friends.

Pub/Space for a birthday party,"Hello r/London! I need some advice on a space to a host a birthday party on April 27th! Ideally:   


* Fits roughly 25-30 people
* A space that has table and chairs! We're boardgamers so it would be great if we could have lots of tables where people could play boardgames like terraforming mars. 
* Also generally chill, i.e. not super noisy pubs or spaces where the music is so loud that you can barely hear each other. 
* Food and drinks at the venue or nearby
* More than happy to rent out the space but ideal would be ones where the venue is happy for us to reserve the space as long as the guests buy food and drinks which I know they will
* Accessible - We have friends with mobility needs so wheelchair accessible with accessible bathrooms would be great!

Community Fibre - Are they really that bad?,"Hey all,

I have been looking at Community Fibre as they're the only FTTP provider I can get in my area. Open Reach state FTTP could be available between now and 2026 which is quite a wide range. The symmetrical up and down CF offer is very enticing as well as the speeds compared to my current speeds (60mbps down and 10mbps down).

The thing that I'm hesitant about is reading the reviews stating customer service is awful, people have been without internet for days, sometimes weeks (I can't have this as I work from home), taking the incorrect amount from people's accounts and engineers not turning up for appointments wether that be for faults or the installation.

Does anyone have any experience with CF? I really do want faster internet but I don't want to be messed around and have no internet for days/weeks.

Rent going down in London,"Firstly, ask yourself who the narrative of demand outstrips supply meaning eternally rising rents really serves.

But in non shared accommodation the competition is not that high.

I have three big reasons why supply is going up.

1. Build to rent.
2. Boomers who own property are now wanting to retire.
3. Other individuals trying to capitalise on high rents.

And reasons why demand is not high.

1. Everything is overpriced to the point people can't afford it leading to ""affordability resistance."" And those who can would rather have high end properties that doesn't touch the general supply or are landlords themselves.
2. Everything is overpriced meaning that immigrants can't afford it leading to ""affordability resistance."" And those immigrants who can would rather have high end properties that doesn't touch the general supply or are landlords themselves.
3. Less people want to move from the property they are currently in due to the fact that doing so for the last ten years has been such a nightmare.

If you don't believe me just go onto zoopla and you will see almost every house now that isn't shared accommodation is being reduced and still not shifting. Some for over 6 months. Right now the market is falling, we are just not seeing it because it's not being widely reported on. Also since the prices are still too high this will mean that the systems that monitor these rents are not adjusting because they are wrongly recording a higher rent that is too high.

So when we have slight drops instead the narrative is that a slight lull but I don't remember seeing so many properties on rightmove or zoopla that are still listed and past their move in date.

There is a lot of doom and gloom when it comes to rental prices in London but I am telling you now that things are getting better. Price of living keeps increasing and wages don't. At a certain point the game can't go on forever and this resistance is the first sign of change.

As a separate point rents outside of london will likely continue to rise simply because they lag behind london being the trend setter and have a ways to go before that reaches unaffordability.","Rent going down in London Firstly, ask yourself who the narrative of demand outstrips supply meaning eternally rising rents really serves.

Most big cities in the world slowly become 24 hour cities. New York, LA, everywhere in Asia with a population greater than 10 million. Yet London had more 24hr places 5 years ago than it does now. On a different note, outdoor seating in central pubs and restaurants are also gone, and I remember reading 10 years ago about Sunday trading laws being relaxed and it never did.

What is going on with the Tram Line?!,"We have just had 2 weeks with no service between Sandilands and Reeves Corner. With terrible passenger management between the replacement bus service and offloading boarding trams.

Now we have been informed that there will be no tram service for a month at the end of march.

This is in addition to a very noticeable reduction of trams across the service, increasing wait times and overloaded trams.

Seems like the trams have been pushed beyond optimal service length, without the procurement of replacement vehicles.

Brazilian in London: Seeking Conversation Topics for First-time,"&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I'll be visiting London for work in March, and I'll be having several lunch meetings with our clients. It seems that during these lunches, clients often prefer to steer away from work-related discussions and engage in more casual conversations to break away from the routine. As it's my first time in London and meeting British people in person, I'd like to know what topics or themes I can bring up that would interest them. Whether it's current affairs or older subjects that still resonate, what are some conversation starters that would engage Londoners and make for enjoyable lunches? Looking forward to your suggestions and insights! Luv from Brazil!!","Brazilian in London: Seeking Conversation Topics for First-time &#x200B;

Poetry Night Connection E3,"Tuesday 27th Feb.

You were with friends at a Poetry Reading in the basement room. You wore a killer aesthetic.

I was on a social with colleagues. I wore a gig tee, jeans and boots.

During the intermission you came over and began a conversation with me.
I gave you the impression I was disinterested, but I genuinely didn’t realise you might’ve been making a pass at me so I just answered directly and to the point 🤦🏻‍♂️ 

My colleagues were all aghast at my obliviousness.

We waited for the second half to finish; Unfortunately we had to look after one of our number who was worse for wear and I didn’t manage to talk to you again as everyone left.

Following the London food scene,"Hi there, A bit of a unique request. I come from Auckland, New Zealand which has a thriving food scene and foodie community. It's a wonderful positive environment where people gladly share their recommendations and it's easy to keep track of new restaurant openings and food events when they happen.

I am able to do this largely by following these two Facebook Groups which operate very similarly to subreddits with users freely posting reviews of restaurants they try and by making discussion posts about what they're looking for. Restaurant owners and chefs also use these platforms to publicise their events. They've become wonderful catalogues of the Auckland food scene and you can use Facebook's native Group search function as a tool to find any type of restaurant for your night out.

* [Chow Luck Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/590817651915936)

My question is, does anything like this exist for London? How do you keep up with the food scene? Are there any Facebook Groups, Instagram accounts, or profiles that I should follow?

I already follow things like Topjaw and other food 'influencer' accounts but I'm looking for a more 'crowd sourced' community feel.

Should I be a Karen on my neighbour and dob them in to the council for illegal dwelling in the garden?,"Right, let me provide some context. Property a few doors away was purchased last year (London Zone 4) by cash buyer (was not mortgageable) but building work only started recently. 
Looked at council planning portal for any applications and could not find any however there was a mention of building a loft conversion, side extension AND an outhouse (no actual planning permission or permitted development notification submitted – weird I know). 
Weeks go by and I can see a loft dormer shell built then they started working on the outhouse. I can see they have built it with pipes for waste (taps, shower, toilet -soil pipes) installed. 
It is nowhere near being complete yet but I strongly believe they will make it into a garden dwelling to rent out (which I understand is illegal in the UK?).
I do not want to spoil my road, increased chance of riff-raff, increased parking congestion, waste requirements etc and the potential future value of my family home to be affected by this. 

Q: What would you do if this was happening to your neighbourhood? 

Can I complain to the council anonymously and will they do anything about this now or do I need to wait until they have actually have a human living there?

NB: I do not care if the owner creates a HMO if it is legal to do so – but I draw the line at illegal dwellings in your garden as that smacks of slum landlord to me.

One additional point to make: There is a house on the opposite side but to the left (so diagonically from the property in question) where the house was converted into a HMO years ago (fine) but about 2 yrs ago the owner built a dwelling in the garden (where the dwelling even has its own fence in front of it to have privacy from the main house AND the electrics are run from the ceiling of the main house LITERALLY dangling in the air into the corner of the dwelling for power – so a big black thick cable traversing about 5m about 3m high (surely that is seriously dangerous?). I can clearly see someone going in and out so he lives there BUT I have not complained to the council because it is not on MY road (however the property in question IS on my road).
Hoping to get some consensus on what one should do in this situation. TIA

Edit: this post has got some decent responses, thank you! Please keep them coming. It really is useful to hear different POVs. 
I purposely used the terms ""Karen"" and ""riff-raff"" because reddit suggests you make the post ""stand out""/ controversial. 
I am really on the fence on what to do because one side of me is saying ""don't be a grass"" and the other side is saying ""they are doing something dodgy here, don't just sit there and be passive, do something about it.
(Many others have already done something similar in my neighbourhood, just not near my home (hence why I did not feel compelled to do anything about it, but it is getting out of hand now). I am a law abiding citizen (maybe to my detriment) but see so many examples of people who do things under the books and are exploiting the system and now people. 
-Do cash in hand jobs to survive and put food in your mouth- sure do what you need to do.
-Use vast sums of cash to make a mini slum building in a residential (mixture of council /ex-council) neighbourhood exploiting desperate tenants with likely no legal protection - no, go f**k yourself.

London is not London anymore. Don't care what anyone says. Living here all my life in my mid 20s now, I feel more and more directionless everyday - looking for creative ways to advance my career/different industries altogether, only to find that the opportunities are slim and for anyone to make it, is more a matter of ""luck"" than anything else.

Anyone else feel the same way about London? ",LastHopeHussein,32,0.44,0,2024-02-28 01:32:34,London

Sick of tailgaters at the Tube barriers,"In the last few months I’ve noticed a huge surge in the number of people fare jumping on the Tube - most irritating are the ones that squeeze through the barriers by tailgating a legitimate fare payer. This has happened to me 3 times already this month and I’m really pissed off about it. I actually turned around and yelled at the woman that did it to me this morning, in the hopes that I’d either alert a member of staff or at the very least embarrass her. No staff in sight, though I may have succeeded a bit with the latter. 

Is there anything that I can do to stop being tailgated, other than having eyes in the back of my head?","Sick of tailgaters at the Tube barriers In the last few months I’ve noticed a huge surge in the number of people fare jumping on the Tube - most irritating are the ones that squeeze through the barriers by tailgating a legitimate fare payer.

Looking for assistance?,"Hey Reddit fam,

I've spent 3 incredible years in London, co-founded a production company, shot a documentary in Ukraine, and my latest film? It's got some awards lining up. But then, plot twist - financial hurdles sent me back to France. Now, I'm on a mission to reunite with the city that stole my heart.

Here's where you come in. I know life's script sometimes needs a little tweaking, and I'm willing to be the supporting character your household might be looking for. If you or someone you know needs a helping hand – be it caring for a parent, a grandmother, or just keeping the house in top-notch shape – I'm your guy.

In exchange for a reduced rent rate, I bring my 23-year-old self, a passion for curiosity, and a skill set that extends from capturing moments on film to conquering grocery runs and maintaining a spick-and-span living space.

 If you have any leads or know someone in need of a responsible and creative sidekick, drop me a line.","Looking for assistance? Hey Reddit fam,

Where to donate a scorpion in London,"I live in West London. Yesterday morning my wife was tidying stuff up under our bed when a... scorpion came crawling out of a shoebox. After a few hours spent disassembling everything under the bed I finally managed to catch the little fella in a jar without killing it. It has small claws so it *does* seem venomous, and it doesn't look like the only species of scorpion [present in the UK](https://www.royensoc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sam-Finnie-Antenna-Essay.pdf). The most likely explanation is that we accidentally brought this back from Mexico - we came back from a holiday there a couple of months ago. It kind of looks like a bark scorpion but I'm not too sure.

Any suggestions on how to get rid of it humanely? It seems like it could be an exotic species, would something like the London Zoo take it? Or is there a conservation centre or something to which I could donate it? I would like to avoid killing it if possible.","Where to donate a scorpion in London I live in West London.

I said I didnt have any money on me now and the fine went down to £50 each. 
One of them started threatening me that it would affect my visa if the letter was sent to my home. 
Bottom line I didnt pay him a dime and he took my home address and had a look at my brp and threatened that this will affect me.

Accessibility: a success story,"As a wheelchair user, I often make complaints about the inaccessibility of London’s travel network, however I think it is important to also celebrate the ‘wins’. Following a successful trial, TfL have rolled out ‘mini ramps’ at stations that are “step-free from street to train” but occasionally turn out not to be. The Northern Line at King’s Cross was one of the worst examples for my wheelchair. I’ve since used the mini ramps and they have allowed stations that are advertised as step free to be step free. 

I am sure that other wheelchair users have experienced the same issue and have made complaints.

If nothing else, it highlights the importance of speaking up and respectfully holding people to account. There is a lot of wicked in the world but sometimes issues are rooted in unawareness and if these aren’t brought to the forefront of people’s attention then they cannot change.

I am sure that other wheelchair users have experienced the same issue and have made complaints.

If nothing else, it highlights the importance of speaking up and respectfully holding people to account. There is a lot of wicked in the world but sometimes issues are rooted in unawareness and if these aren’t brought to the forefront of people’s attention then they cannot change.

Co-working spaces in London - what are they like?,"So I currently work from home 3-4 days a week and I am finding it pretty lonely. My team is very small too (just me and my manager), hence why I don’t go into the office more.

Looking for artists to share their 'artist date' choices, which is an experience that helps fill the creative well. Does anyone have any recommendations for weird things happening, or where to look for off-the-grid type events?

  
Btw -- it doesn't have to be any kind of art.  Just something that might be interesting or special in some way. I particularly enjoy heavy machinery doing its thing. 

  
Thanks for any suggestions!

Some heartwarming anti-crime story ,"This actually happened a few months ago but I thought it's a good story.

I went to my favourite climbing gym, Stronghold in Tottenham, and when I arrived I just dropped my whole stuff on a bench in the changing room. I put my phone on the bench and went away to wash my hands, put my bag in a locker, take off my shoes. I turn back and see my phone is gone. I felt so naive I leave my phone laying around quite often as I just want to put it down for a second and then forget about it. 

Anyhow, I tell my partner who is there too, my heart is racing. He asks me if I'm sure I left my phone on the bench or if it's in my bag. I say I'm sure but we check the badlg, locker, it's not there. 

He tells me to take a deep breath, relax, accept the phone is gone. We have to get a new one. Need to not get too upset about it, it's over basically. 

Then we try calling it from my partners phone. It's ringing, but can't hear any vibration in the room. 

Suddenly someone comes in, my phone in their hand, super apologetic, saying he took it by accident, he doesn't know how that happened. I'm so super happy to have my phone, my heart drops a beat. I tell him it's fine, no problem, it happens. I was so relieved, so lucky I got it back!

ULEZ Charge help,"Hi, I wondered if anyone had experience with something like this or can advise me here.

So, I drove in the ULEZ zone 4 days ago, I had originally thought the grace period to pay was 3 working days, not just 3 calendar days (I drove for work on Thursday, and planned on paying for the charge at work on Monday morning). 

I’ve tried to pay the charge online however now as I’m aware it’s past the 3 day period it won’t let me choose the correct day and therefore I’m a bit stuck.

I spoke to transport for London via web chat, to which they were 0 help, and just kept saying it’s past the 3 day deadline so there’s nothing they can do. 

I also phoned the help line to which the man there said the same, however I did get him to write a note against my account and number plate saying how it was a mistake as I had thought it was 3 working days. 

I’m now in the abyss of waiting for a PCN notice, of which I’m not in a position to forgo £180. I also think this is completely wrong, and there should be a system in place for those like me who are actively trying to pay for the charge even before they receive a PCN?

Also, I spoke to the enforcement team for transport for london, and they said there isn’t even a PCN issued for my registration yet.

Is there anything anyone has done or would recommend doing regarding this? Or is there a sure fire way to challenge a PCN if and when it’s issued? I’m aware these things are set up to make you just pay it and “take your medicine” as challenging it runs the risk of paying the full fine and not a reduced rate.

"Calls from London Metropolitan, is this a scam call?","

Hi, I just got a call from Victoria Embankment London. 

She said that some drugs were sent to China and it was under my name & phone number which I never tried at all. (I am a Korean though) She said that I need to call to the Chinese police station saying that I am innocent and that is the only way for now??? I asked her if she could send me the information about the Chinese police station (name, phone number) via email, and she said that she couldn't because this is credential information so she will call me again?

I am wondering if this is a spam call or a real incident. I thought it was a spam call so I hung up and ignored the calls several times but she calls me multiple times. 

Does anyone have any idea?


---------

Thank you so much for everyone. My Chinese husband came back from work and said that it's 100% scam. On the phone call, I told the scammer that I couldn't speak Chinese so she should call me in a couple hours then my husband would deal with it. But she didn't call me back.

Looking for a Dutch person who lives in London to help a student! ,"Hello!

I’m a 20 y/o student from the Netherlands. Currently, I study journalism! For this semester, I’ll travel to London from 29th of April until the 3th of May. I’ll compare the wheelchair accessiblity of London and its public transport with that of the Netherlands. As a wheelchair user myself, this might be interesting!

Now I have two questions for those living in London! The first question goes for everyone, the second one only for Dutch people in London.

1. Are you, or do you know, a wheelchair user who perhaps would like to do an interview? I’ll ask about your experience’s living in London as a wheelchair user. 

2. I’ll be traveling with my parents due to my disability but school requires me to still find a local who wants to be my emergency contact. I will most likely not have an emergency since I’ll be with my parents, but it is still a necessity. My teacher will want your name + phone number. It is preferable if you’re Dutch and can speak Dutch! I won’t need to contact you a lot. It isn’t a hard task. But perhaps so now and then I might sent a whatsapp message about which tube I should take. ;) But it is more about a requirement need for school than a real necessity.

Seeking Talented Street Performers I Captured Last Year!," Hey fellow Redditors! 

A year ago, I stumbled upon an incredibly talented group of street performers and managed to capture some amazing moments through my lens. The energy and creativity were off the charts.

Now, I'm on a mission to share these photos with the street performers. If you or anyone you know was part of that street performance group around London last year, I'd love to get in touch.

Cheap shisha cafe London,"Hi guys,

Originally from Manchester where we’ve got 24 hour £10 shisha lounges and then spent time in Birmingham where there’s £5 24 shisha lounges (usually Somali run, looks like a living room and probably hiding from the council and police but shisha is usually decent) - there’s quite a few of these. 

Recently moved to London, can’t find anything cheaper than £15 - does anyone know anything cheaper? Only smoke al fakher… and usually twice a day so can’t afford to be spending so much 🤣

Anything close to even £10? the place doesn’t have to look nice at all, just needs a seat of some kind and a shisha…

Thanks in advance","Cheap shisha cafe London Hi guys,

#[the r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index)

It includes sections on:

**What should I see and where are the non-touristy stuff and hidden gems?**  
We've written about the big must-sees [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/thingstosee) and we highly recommend [TfL's Experiences site](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london).   
We've listed some of our favourite lesser-known stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/secretlondon)
And the cheap/free stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/lowbudget)

**How do I pay for the Tube/bus, and what's an Oyster card?**    
You don't pay cash.  You can use a number of contactless payments systems such as your Contactless bankcard (which is widespread in the UK, but maybe not so much elsewhere), Apple Pay, Android Pay, or you can buy an Oyster card and top it up with credit.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) for more.

**Where should I live? What's x area like?**  
Have a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/living)  
It includes recommended sites to find places to live and rent, and has a section on what particular areas are like.

**How do I get from this place to that place?**  
Use [Citymapper](http://citymapper.com).  Honestly, we're not shills for them; it's just a really good app and is used by most of the locals on this sub.  

**Is x area safe?**  
Yes. Bad stuff can happen in any large city, but London is generally very safe.  There aren't any no-go zones.  Even under the shadow of terrorist attacks, most Londoners feel safe.  See [our safety page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/safety) for more.

**Where can I watch the baseball/basketball/football/handegg match?**  
A comprehensive guide to all London football matches in all leagues can be found at [tlfg.uk](http://www.tlfg.uk). Use [Fanzo](https://www.fanzo.com/en/best-pubs-in-london/3128) to find pubs showing a variety of sports and see our list of other places [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/sport)

**How do I get a UK SIM card for my phone?**  
Advice on networks and how to get a SIM card is covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/connectivity).

**Tips for posting:**

**Tell us about you** - If you want us to suggest things for you to do then you need to give us a good idea of what you enjoy. Don't just say ""I like music"", say what type of music. Don't just say you want ""somewhere nice to eat"", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki.

**Tell us your budget** - If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something ""cheap"" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective.

**Tell us where you'll be based** - Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations.

**Asking about hotels or hostels** - We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say ""I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?"" then that's the sort of thing we can answer.

**Non-touristy stuff** - There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki).

Free things to do - Microsoft Experience Centre (Oxford circus),"I went to the gaming centre, Microsoft Experience Centre, to spend Sunday afternoon and it was a lot of fun. It’s on the first floor of the Microsoft store - no need to book but you might wait for a turn on busy days.

A great place to go for free (minus travelling there). Great day out if you’re short on cash, stuck for ideas and like to play Xbox.

It was Sunday so it wasn’t busy so we stayed on a large screen with two controllers for 2 and a half hours and left because we were tired as opposed to being asked to move. We played Fortnight, Bluey, Minecraft and some other games that were on the console. 

Great fun! Will definitely go again.","Free things to do - Microsoft Experience Centre (Oxford circus) I went to the gaming centre, Microsoft Experience Centre, to spend Sunday afternoon and it was a lot of fun.

Incident in Angel today,"Today there was an incident in Angel; there was a heavy police and ambulance presence by a few shops near the Tesco Express, I think right by Islington Green.

Why do people talk in the theatre?,"My nieces were visiting me last night and so I took them to see Matilda (fantastic show) but one thing that marred the performance was several groups just chatting/laughing the entire way through as if they were in their living room.  

N.B not laughing at the show, which is very funny, but just at their own chat/jokes throughout. None of the people were children or with children either. One group was also just singing off key with hit and miss lyrics to every song.

Don’t get me wrong, whether you are in the cinema or theatre there is usually one joker doing something mildly annoying, but it’s usually fine for the most part. I feel I was particularly unlucky to be sat between 3 groups of ‘chatters’.

They were even shushed at by other people (I wouldn’t dream, sorry) but to no avail. 

In my opinion it’s so rude both to the people around you and to the performers. But on top of being rude, you’ve paid £60+ to get in here, why wouldn’t you want to take it all in? 

But I almost want to hear from those who would see chatting/laughing at normal volume throughout as acceptable. Why is this ok?

My nieces didn’t seem to care and loved the show. For the sake of them not seeing their uncle being a grump I never even brought up how annoyed I was at these fools. I’m at least grateful they had a magical time. So sorry, you folks are getting my whinge instead. ","Why do people talk in the theatre?

There are multi factors why I moved really but I secured a much, much better paid job elsewhere in the country and it was just time to start afresh.
For some background I grew up in Newcastle, but joined the Air Force quite young and then have worked for NATO since I left the Air force, so I’ve lived a lot of places, but settled in London in 2018.
I always though London was okay, not great, but okay. Never felt at home. 

But, here’s the tricky bit for me because as someone who has a past history of posting mainly negative/neutral comments about London posts in here, I have to be very honest takes a lot of adjusting when you do leave.
A lot. 
The adjustment period is real. 

If your not happy in London, moving away from it won’t automatically cure all your issues. 
I only say that because I’ve seen so many posts recently with people talking about leaving the city to become happy again. 
It won’t work like that.

As much I’m glad I left London a few months ago, even I cannot deny there are some things are just irreplaceable, the tube and public transport being the main one.
But just the convenience of things too like shops open 24 hours a day, variety of things etc.
There’s also the pace of things, it’s just very noticeable when you go to a smaller city. 

To summarise, I’m glad I left London because I wouldn’t want to raise a family there, just too much happening that I wasn’t a fan of. 
I have a 4 bed house now that I would never be able to have in London. 
But, if your thinking of leaving, please consider all the factors and just by moving away, it won’t have some sort of “reset” effect on you.
It takes time.
Eventually, if you structure it right (the move) it will be beneficial, but it’s not an overnight thing and people need to consider it. 
It took my wife even longer to get used to it and she missed it a lot more than me, but she has her own car now, doesn’t get harassed by men as she walked to and from work anymore either, (which is priceless really) and gets paid essentially the same money.
We planned this move for almost a year, so we where prepared as best we could be.

Hope this comes across as an brutally honest post because i have been wrong about certain things in London and what city can offer, but hopefully, others might take stock from this before making any rash decisions.

currently sitting at LTN airport. This isn't the first time however - every single time I come here it feels like they've got the temperatures cranked up  way too high.

Loneliness rant,"I generally feel lonely in London. I grew up here but suffering from depression and moving a lot has meant that I haven't been able to maintain relationships.

I know I'll get through it but I just wish I didn't have to be so strong all the time. It's exhausting.","Loneliness rant I generally feel lonely in London. I grew up here but suffering from depression and moving a lot has meant that I haven't been able to maintain relationships.

"London based company ""Casting Talent UK"" is a scam. Everything you need to know.","Before I explain this fully please note that this company checks Reddit and posts fake positive comments in any posts regarding them. If there are comments below in their favour please check the commenters Reddit history before casting your judgement.

TLDR: They ask for money (£400-£600) for a photoshoot to ""build your profile"". They abandon you once the photoshoot is finished.

The following information is based on my own experience and that of the 10 negative and seemingly only real reviews on [Trust Pilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/castingtalent.online?stars=1&stars=2).

Warning signs:

* They Refuse to communicate through email or give you anything in writing
* At no point do they check your right to work in the UK
* They use a rented office space with no company branding
* They are not a registered business on Google
* No listed company phone number
* Zero examples of their work on their website
* Low follower, likes and comment counts across all social medias and yet claim to have collaborated with brands such as Netflix and Nike
* Positive reviews of the company are clearly written by bots or riddled with the same broken English as the company's replies

[It's always great to find a company that explain me so good and how I need to do.](https://preview.redd.it/3j3c29lyekkc1.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=f56abc803e5d094daf6ce54fd9ad40d1f0fa5491)

They give you a call and ask you to attend a casting call at short notice. Their office is rented in central London. I arrived and was soon joined by 5 or 6 other people who I spoke to and said they had no experience in the industry. After a 1-2 hour wait they make you fill out a poorly printed form and then bring you into their tiny dirty office. Regardless of what talents you have listed they will encourage you to list that you can do everything on their list all whilst showering you with praise. ""You have very beautiful eyes"", ""You are so beautiful"", ""I love your personality"", ""You're so X, you're so Y"". They then show you jobs that you could potentially acquire with their ""help"". The jobs they show you are listed on the legitimate casting website [Spotlight](https://www.spotlight.com/) which they use to give themselves credibility and gain your trust. You are shown an advert that they apparently supplied extras for, despite the company I was shown being one of the world's biggest, this supposed collaboration is not listed on their website.

*Money time.*

They tell you that if you're chosen (to be scammed) then they will arrange a photoshoot costing £400-£450 which will (of course) require an additional processing fee of £200. You are told this information very quickly and encouraged not to ask questions. Like all trustworthy law abiding tax paying businesses they naturally are willing to accept this payment in cash.

[The bot was very happy with this excellent review.](https://preview.redd.it/9st8fd71fkkc1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5befd3a0299168c3c9c2b895a406368a10f8126)

In conclusion [Casting Talent UK](https://www.castingtalent.online/) or Casting Talent Online (they haven't decided which) is a real life scam run by experienced heartless con-artists under the guise of just being a bad business.

Building mgmt prohibiting use of lift for moving large items,"I saw a note outside the lift in my building from the building management company stating that anyone caught using the lift to move in and out their flat, or large items (I'm assuming things like a couch or a dresser) will be fined.

The building is 3 stories with about 80+ flats split into two ""halves"". One lift serving one section and another serving the other.

The lift irself is small, fits about 10 people if sardined. There have been issues with the lift overall, and needs a lot of maintenance. So I see where the motivation is coming from, but it seems extremely punitive especially if you are on the third floor and need to move a large item or multiple boxes.

Is this legal for the management company to do this? Would the fine have any teeth whatsoever? 

I did a google search and most of it was about landlord responsibility vs a management company. Appreciate any insights or if anyone has experienced similar things.

the Holburn standing two abreast escalator experiment,"does anyone remember this?  it was sometime in the last decade: at Holborn Underground Station, they tried out a rule where you weren't allowed to walk up the escalators; you had to stand on both sides of it. the idea was that it resulted in more throughput up the escalator. in practise, most people just ignored the rule and walked up it anyway, but it was quite fun when some people obeyed the rule, resulting in some annoyed people stuck behind them all the way up. would love to know what the conclusion of it was, but given that they don't do it anymore, it was obviously decided to be a bad idea

London has been making me feel heavily depressed. Cheer me up with some great things about living in this city!,"In the past month or so I've been depressed over finding a place to live and getting ghosted or messed about on Spareroom, going through a long term break up, being single as a gay guy and having to date in London (🤢), working extra hours to get a promotion so I just about afford day-to-day living and feeling like I have no close friends to look out for me as a 31 year old male since my close friends are in relationships.

I am extremely luckily enough to have therapy and I'm also taking antidepressants, but all of this has come at once and I've never felt so low and hopeless about the state of my life at the moment. Feels like I'm trying my hardest but nothing is working the way I want it to be and it's my fault since I'm a terrible person.

So /r/London, I'm asking for your help for you to make me optimistic about living here again. What are some things or events that I can do to see the good in people again? How can I make solid connections with male friends? And how I become desirable and worthy as a person in London?

Party pubs/clubs for the young at heart.,"So as someone who is over 50 I'm looking for places to go which have a party vibe but more for the young at heart. Nothing against the younger generation but wish to go somewhere I don't feel out of place😁.

It can be during the day at night midweek or at the weekend, it can be DJ, karaoke, live music or just some decent background music. And anywhere in the greater London area.

I go to London every now and then and suggestions always seem to be things like museums, going to music recitals and though I do enjoy those I still enjoy a good party.

I can't be the only one surely 😄

Any suggestions greatly received.

Anyone else disappointed with the live music scene nowadays?,"Is it just me, have i just aged, or is it just that popular music now is digital? 

I(f35) remember back when I was younger nearly everywhere I went had fantastic live music of some sort, or upcoming talented artists were busking the streets (unpopular opinion but it's unlike some of the good but often ""meh"" artists I see out there atm). Everyone would congregate even if it wasn't their choice of music, it was just fun to be there and there was always a great atmosphere.

At the time there was a huge indie/rock scene which helped but there were also other incredible artists that were combining or progressing genres, it was exciting to discover something new each time. I know a lot of the younger generation are into more electronic music nowadays(i dont mean to generalise but this is how it seems), and there's some really talented upcoming DJ's, but honestly that's mostly what I can find. Oh and cover bands.

Now there's few places that give me a similar sense of discovery that have kept going but not as busy I.e Old blue last in Shoreditch, Rough Trade east and various places in Camden, anyone have any other suggestions?

Don't get me wrong, I know bigger artists play at great event venues such as the o2 etc and there's always something happening at ronnie Scots and koko etc. Tickets cost a fortune sadly for these types of events and often sold out. What about the up and coming?

"Failing at ""London""","I am in my late 30s now. Twice in my 20s I tried to ""make"" in London but I didn't. I was lonely, broke, tired and directionless.

Central line Update,"I've just received word that the Central Line temporary timetable starts **Monday**

Frequency of trains:

Epping - Leytonstone **every 8 mins**

Hainault - Leytonstone (via Newbury Park) **every 5 mins**

Woodford - Hainault shuttle **every 20 mins**

Leytonstone - White City **every 2-4 mins**

White City - North Acton **every 3-5 mins**

North Acton - Ealing Broadway **every 10 mins**

North Acton - West Ruislip **every 7 mins**

&#x200B;

* This temporary timetable is only in effect Monday - Thursday
* These timings are subject to short-term cancellations, pending available trains
* 21 trains per hour will operate between White City and Leytonstone, with the provision to offer a 24 train per hour service

**Why a new timetable?**

This new emergency timetable allows for trains to be reshuffled and makes gaps in the service less noticeable, despite running less trains.

**What's been going on with the Central Line?**

As we all know - the Central Line has been a pain to use due to defective train motors. This has led to long term train cancellations, hence why a new timetable is required to make the gaps in the service less noticeable

**When will the Central Line go back to normal?**

No one knows, could be months, years even.

**Why is it taking so long to repair the motors?**

One defective traction motor can take an **entire** train out of service. They are failing at a higher rate than they can be repaired. Once a motor fails, it is sent off for repair where highly skilled engineers strip the traction motor down bare and repair it. It is difficult to repair them as the parts for the motors are no longer made so the engineers have to use whatever they can to repair them

Slightly creepy situation on the overground - should I have said something? ,"So tonight I got the overground going from Highbury & Islington going towards Clapham Junction. Two or three stops in a man sat in the next but one seat and got out a notebook/sketchpad sort of thing and started scribbling - not exactly a common thing to see but I didn’t think anything of it at first until I noticed he kept looking up and staring at me and other people in the carriage. I thought it was a bit weird so I glanced over, I then noticed that he had drawn detailed sketches of the people sitting opposite and seemed to be doing the same with me. 

I was properly weirded out but I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I just moved away and got off at the next station. I’m now wondering though - the guy hadn’t asked permission or said anything, the other people in the carriage didn’t seem to have noticed as they were all on their phones or reading, so should I have maybe challenged him or at least let them know that they were being drawn? On the other hand, am I being dramatic and overreacting to something innocent?

District Line Rant,"I just need to get it out of me - why is it, on busy commuting mornings I get on an Upminster train every morning only to get told at Earls Court this is now a High Street Kensington train and EVERYONE proceeds to get off leaving an empty train behind. 

The inevitable then happens where you’re stuck worse than sardines on the next actual Upminster train when this could have been entirely avoided -WHY???

Walk in tattoo in the Wembley area?,"Hi all,

"Stuck with only slow internet options in Zone 3 London, anything I can do?","Hello fellow Londoners, I have a question for the more technically knowledgable among you. Do I have any chance of getting a faster internet connection if the block of flats I live in is currently limited to ""BT FFTC""? I've been trying to ask about getting a faster connection, and it turns out my entire block and several nearby blocks in Zone 3 SW London are apparently limited to download speeds of  \~60 MBps because faster connections are simply not capable of being connected. Something about FTTC which we have, but not FTTP, which I had never heard of before. 

Does anybody who understands these things know if there is any way at all to get a faster a connection in this situation? I've looked into for example Hyperoptic which I used to use when I lived more centrally and found to be very good, but they are on stage 1/5 of their assessment process and have been for several months which doesn't fill me with hope.

Can I get FTTP installed? Who would you even petition about this, building management? BT? Is there any point?

The slow internet speeds are becoming really problematic, and it seems surprising there would be no options at all, would love to find a solution, cheers","Stuck with only slow internet options in Zone 3 London, anything I can do?

Thames Clipper wheelchair accessibility ,"Thought I’d post about my experience catching the clipper the other week for anyone in a similar position wanting to know what it’s like. My partner and I are both independent active chair users and we travelled return Westminster - Greenwich. 

I used to catch the clipper with my family as a kid (pre wheelchair) so I was excited to see on their website that they were wheelchair accessible.

Getting to the pier from Westminster tube station was really smooth. Came out the ticket barriers, headed left and down a ramp to an exit. Headed left then turned right around the wall. There was a set of stairs, and a sign showing a small ramp alternative. It was a bit bumpy and could do with being re-surfaced but glad to see it there! Headed down the pier, it was a bit steep so gloves and grippy handrims are a must especially if there’s people about. 

While waiting for the boat we were moved to the front of the queue for easier boarding. The boarding ramp is curved and if you have a tippy chair like mine you will need to grab onto the handrails and pull yourself along to avoid tipping. My partner got across fine with a less tippy chair. The threshold of the door is a few centimetres high but we were both able to get over it. Just make sure to go at it straight and not at an angle. The corridors were just wide enough for people to walk past us in 16/17” chairs, wider or more bulky ones might struggle. 

We were disappointed when we got onto the boat and found out that there were no designated wheelchair spaces even though the website says there is space for four wheelchairs. We were told to sit at the front of the boat, in the foot space between the seats facing forwards and the seats facing backwards. We weren’t allowed anywhere else by law as we would then be obstructing the exit routes. It was very awkward because the people sitting around us couldn’t move about easily, there were lots of prams, and when people were exiting the boat they were climbing over us and bumping into our chairs. We ended up feeling a bit like a burden and like we were in everyone’s way, which isn’t nice when you’re on a 45 minute trip. But at least the views were lovely!

At Greenwich pier we used the boarding ramp as before and thought we were in the clear until we got to the pier. It was low tide, and the ramp up to street level was at about a 50 degree angle. We tried to get up by ourselves (I very valiantly pulled on the handrail) but had to admit defeat and accept help from fellow passengers. Once we got to the top we saw there was a lift ! And for some reason we were never offered assistance even though they asked us where we were getting off. Other than the sweat and breathlessness we made it! There was a nasty bump between the ramp and the pavement so again be careful if your chair is tippy. 

On the way back I needed a bit of help to get over the bump, and the ramp required good grip on the handrims. The journey was pretty much the same, just a bit busier. The hot chocolate was good! 

At westminster, we tried the route labelled “way out” and unfortunately ended up on a staircase with no way to go but back the way we came. So we went back and exited through the way we entered in the morning. The small bumpy ramp at westminster was more of a challenge to get up than down. And the ramp inside the tube station is a little steep, so you need decent strength. 

We had a lovely day, and I was really happy I could show my girlfriend some of the places I visited as a child. Being able to catch the clipper as a wheelchair user is really cool, and I’m glad that I am not prohibited from these experiences. It is disappointing to be misled by the clipper website, but at least we were allowed onboard!

If you are a wheelchair user, I would recommend having a friend/carer with you if you would like to travel. If you have a powerchair or mobility scooter, you may find your chair won’t handle the slopes involved and it would be hard to navigate on the boat itself. If your chair is relatively slim, I would call ahead and make sure any lifts are functional and the crew is aware.

And, no, the Onlyfans Party is not what you think it is but the two gals running that night are amazing.

[Get On It! @ Camden Assembly (29/02):](https://premier.ticketek.co.uk/Shows/Show.aspx?sh=GEONIT23) This one is recommended by another redditor,  **Plus\_Try4102.** Camden Assembly is a great venue so I\`m pretty sure it would be a great time. This is on 29th, not this week btw.

Her voice is a beacon of vulnerable power with tracks like ‘Get On You’ and ‘Here I Go’ boasting catchy hooks and anthemic choruses that have the makings for chart hits. Balanced out with more laid back and soulful tunes like ‘What Are We’, it’s a fact that Winnie Ama has a magnetic live act that you’d be a fool to miss.

[So Fresh So Clean - A Celebration of Usher @ 25 Paul Street (23/02):](https://ra.co/events/1846640) If you like Usher and RnB, So Fresh So Clean is hosting a special night. Just make sure your partners are securely attached to you because that man absolutely steal yours if you seen the Superbowl performance wtih Alicia Keys

>ALL USHER, ALL NIGHT: From ""Yeah!"" to ""Burn"", we're spinning Usher's greatest hits that defined a generation. Let's groove to the tunes of a true RnB icon!  DRESS TO IMPRESS: Embody the Usher vibe! Whether it's chic, sleek, or unique, make sure you stand out. Snap and share your best looks of the night. #UsherStyle

This specific event sounds great fun but OBL is also an amazing early drinks pub and independent live music venue so definitely make sure you visit it sometime.

>As part of a February residency, we'll be joined by trad/ folk band Bonnie Blue who invite you for a Cèilidh downstairs at The Old Blue Last. The band play from 8pm-11pm and you can expect - as the band put it - ""A mix of traditional Scottish and Irish tunes, with our own wee spin. Good vibes guarenteed."" 

A **FREE** ceilidh / trad night? Hell yeah! Another one I\`m going to miss this week, unfortunately.

[Out of Office feat Mellowmatic @ The Amazing Grace (23/02):](https://amazinggraceldn.com/parties-listing/out-of-office-live-bands-djs/) I\`ve seen Mellowmatic before in Hootananny and can say they are experts at getting the crowd going. Amazing Grace is also a great venue, maybe slightly touristy because it\`s in the goddamn middle of the London Bridge area but still great time. Live band plus DJs all night

>Put your Out of Office on and get your weekend started, at Amazing Grace!  
>  
>Featuring disco, funk, soul, and old-school hip-hop musicians and DJs from all across the UK to deliver a night of excellent music.

Okay, I\`m running out of time to dig for new events so I\`ll rapid fire some recommendations and ramblings as I do all week:

\-**Ronnie Scott's** Funky Nation Weekly residency is always fun, if you have never been before, this is the week. Go there on Saturday

\-**Side Hustle** in Covent Garden is a GREAT second date spot but lordly lord the cocktails can get pretty expensive

\-**The Lexington** is Hosting both **White Heat (indie)** and **Pop Never Dies** club nights on Friday and Saturday, respectively

\-**Folklore** in Hackney ALWAYS have something funky and amazing going on, definitely give it a go sometime

\-**Bloomsbury Bowling Lanes** is having a **So Fetch Party**. If you need and explanation on what that might entail, I don\`t have anything to tell to you

\-There is never a bad time to go to Blues Kitchen Shoreditch / Camden / Brixton, especially Thursday-Friday-Saturday. I think Brixton one is now having HipHop nights on Friday, check their listings

\-**Trisha\`s** on Friday nights, catch up Florence for some smooth as hell French Jazz and old tunes live. It\`s also always poppin off on Sundays

\-**Archer Street SW11** remains to maintain the most absurd women to men ratio on the planet.

\-Dating in London is mad expensive now, like, Jesus H Christ. Thanks to **Louche Soho**, at least I have a spot for happy hour and cocktails are really good. It also doubles as where you could find yourself a date if you stick around for music and DJs on the weekends wink wink, nudge nudge

Anyway, I\`m a bit short on time this week but wouldn\`t wanted to leave my lovelies without a thread. We complained about January not ending and now we\`re nearly in March, time flies by and see you next week y\`all!

Question on Communal Heating Traiffs,"Hi there,

I started the process of buying a shared ownership flat. As it's a new build, it has a communal heating system (gas). I was looking at the tariffs, which are too high compared to this year's average. I am reading this wrong.

The development charges the following for a one-bed flat.
Heat Unit Charge - £0.15726 pence/kWh
Daily Standing Charge - £0.95p

I looked online, and I saw the following
Heat Unit Charge - £0.15726 pence/kWh

Advice and assistance will be welcome.

On one hand offering key workers discounts and on the other hiking up prices due to frequency. Capitalism at its finest.

"Group dining, Hammersmith area","Hi all

Can anyone recommend a decent restaurant (not expensive) in the Hammersmith area, that can accommodate a group of about 20 people? 

I'm part of a club that is visiting London in April, and around 20 of us would like to meet up for dinner. We were looking at pub function rooms for a party, but with only 20 the main hire charge makes it expensive. So we're now thinking of a group dinner at a pub or restaurant, with drinks after. We have some dietary restrictions in the group, so would need gluten free,  veggie and vegan options, and dairy free too if possible. 

Does anywhere spring to mind?","Group dining, Hammersmith area Hi all

I won't blame my phone as I tried either with the latest iPhone and a Samsung s23.Same result 


Do you have signal with other networks?
As I live in Ealing it is a bit frustrating that many times I couldn't book an Uber....or even checking bus timetables is impossible.

Water depth of River Thames?,"I'm writing a script that involves a massive creature that comes westward towards London from the ocean through the River Thames. I am not from the U.K. but I am aware that the Thames gets quite shallow around Central London.

Why are Foxtons’s so shite,"Title says it all. 

It’s been battle after battle with them as our estate agency for a sale. The service they suggest during valuations is nothing like what you get. They over inflate valuations, have terrible marketing materials (their site can hardly filter requirements), and silly listing policies/ conditions on strategy that they don’t advise you of in advance. They sell the idea that you get multiple offices so 3x exposure, but in reality, it just means service is diluted and their team is 3x less educated about an area. 

Hate that we have wasted 4 months with this firm. Once that term is up we will definitely terminate and write a 1 star review - not sure how this company can say they are number 1 in London. 

Any estate agents that are actually half decent out there? This system is such a scam.","Why are Foxtons’s so shite Title says it all.

Coach prices/flexibility from Stansted & Luton airports,"When I travel into London, I usually land at one of the above two but what I do is I book coach tickets in advance because I do not know how much they will cost in person. This usually means I lock in a cheap price (at the moment that's £10 in 3 weeks from now), but it also means that I'm nervous as I don't want to miss that coach, as I assume I will have to pay again otherwise. Similarly, if I manage to get out of security quicker than expected, I may have too long a wait for my booked coach. Hence, it's actually easier to not book ahead and hop onto the next available bus into London.

My question is, does anyone have any knowledge about this in terms of whether the prices go up the way that the prices go up for other UK journeys? Or do the prices remain static for those airport journeys? I can't imagine they go up too much because you'd otherwise hop on the train for about £20. And what happens if they are all booked up? I presume I would have no choice but to get the train? At Stansted there is always a huge line waiting for the coach but I don't know whether they have tickets or not but can only assume quite a few don't.

Best North London Nightlife?,"My friends are coming down for the weekend and I want to show them a good night out.

I only go out once a month or so and when I do it’s techno/DNB events which is not their scene at all. They’re more pop/house/throwback people which I like but haven’t got round to going. 
I moved north a few months ago and haven’t been actual “clubbing” in that area yet. 

Somewhere ideally with no entry fee, the vibe we have in mind is Infernos but less shit, we’re quite partial to gay clubs as well (better music and fewer grabby men).

"Weekly Q&A Megathread. Please post any questions about visiting, tourism, living, working, budgeting, housing here!","#Hello, welcome to London!  
*Visiting us?  Moving to study or work?  Brief layover? Moving to a new part of London? Any small questions about life here, if you're new or been here your whole life, this is the place!*

We get a lot of posts asking very similar questions so this post aims to address some of our most Frequently Asked Questions, and give you a place to ask for assistance.

Your first port of call should be  
#[the r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index)

It includes sections on:

**What should I see and where are the non-touristy stuff and hidden gems?**  
We've written about the big must-sees [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/thingstosee) and we highly recommend [TfL's Experiences site](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london).   
We've listed some of our favourite lesser-known stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/secretlondon)
And the cheap/free stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/lowbudget)

**How do I pay for the Tube/bus, and what's an Oyster card?**    
You don't pay cash.  You can use a number of contactless payments systems such as your Contactless bankcard (which is widespread in the UK, but maybe not so much elsewhere), Apple Pay, Android Pay, or you can buy an Oyster card and top it up with credit.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) for more.

**Where should I live? What's x area like?**  
Have a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/living)  
It includes recommended sites to find places to live and rent, and has a section on what particular areas are like.

**How do I get from this place to that place?**  
Use [Citymapper](http://citymapper.com).  Honestly, we're not shills for them; it's just a really good app and is used by most of the locals on this sub.  

**Is x area safe?**  
Yes. Bad stuff can happen in any large city, but London is generally very safe.  There aren't any no-go zones.  Even under the shadow of terrorist attacks, most Londoners feel safe.  See [our safety page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/safety) for more.

**Where can I watch the baseball/basketball/football/handegg match?**  
A comprehensive guide to all London football matches in all leagues can be found at [tlfg.uk](http://www.tlfg.uk). Use [Fanzo](https://www.fanzo.com/en/best-pubs-in-london/3128) to find pubs showing a variety of sports and see our list of other places [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/sport)

**How do I get a UK SIM card for my phone?**  
Advice on networks and how to get a SIM card is covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/connectivity).  
It also includes suggestions of cafés and other places where you can get free wifi and do a bit of work.

**Tips for posting:**

**Tell us about you** - If you want us to suggest things for you to do then you need to give us a good idea of what you enjoy. Don't just say ""I like music"", say what type of music. Don't just say you want ""somewhere nice to eat"", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki.

**Tell us your budget** - If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something ""cheap"" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective.

**Tell us where you'll be based** - Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations.

**Asking about hotels or hostels** - We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say ""I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?"" then that's the sort of thing we can answer.

**Non-touristy stuff** - There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki).

Looking for women’s martial arts/self defence in London,"Hi! I (23f) have been living in London for about 5 years, having moved from a small town.

 I feel like I’ve reached a point where I’m feeling unsafe way too often. Constant creeps, getting followed home and stared at. I mostly walk about in baggy clothes and big hoodies, to make myself look a bit less easily kidnappable lmao. This morning I had a pretty fucked up 30 minutes where I was followed to my workplace, and it really shook me up.

 I’d love to be able to feel like if the worst came to the worst, I’d be able to defend myself from creeps or attackers, but I’m honestly pretty weak. I’ve been looking into martial arts/self defence classes, including classes that help with de-escalation etc, and am very open to suggestions. Does anyone here know of any good self defence classes or schools that could help? I’m a total newbie, and open to mixed sex classes, but I feel like maybe a female led/focused class might be more beneficial.

I haven’t got a crazy high budget, but I’m willing to invest in my own safety. I’m based in central, so would prefer something pretty central but am down to commute for the right vibes! 

If you have any suggestions or tips then lay em on me :)) 


EDIT: Thank you everyone!! I really appreciate all of these comments and suggestions. I’m looking into all of these, and am planning on going to a couple of taster classes to find the right thing. The aim right now is to choose something that will initially teach me to throw a good, hard punch. Hopefully whatever I go for, paired with some good old cardio and strength training will result in a fitness level where I can sprint the fuck away!

 I feel like I’ve reached a point where I’m feeling unsafe way too often. Constant creeps, getting followed home and stared at. I mostly walk about in baggy clothes and big hoodies, to make myself look a bit less easily kidnappable lmao. This morning I had a pretty fucked up 30 minutes where I was followed to my workplace, and it really shook me up.

 I’d love to be able to feel like if the worst came to the worst, I’d be able to defend myself from creeps or attackers, but I’m honestly pretty weak. I’ve been looking into martial arts/self defence classes, including classes that help with de-escalation etc, and am very open to suggestions. Does anyone here know of any good self defence classes or schools that could help? I’m a total newbie, and open to mixed sex classes, but I feel like maybe a female led/focused class might be more beneficial.

I haven’t got a crazy high budget, but I’m willing to invest in my own safety. I’m based in central, so would prefer something pretty central but am down to commute for the right vibes! 

If you have any suggestions or tips then lay em on me :)) 


EDIT: Thank you everyone!! I really appreciate all of these comments and suggestions. I’m looking into all of these, and am planning on going to a couple of taster classes to find the right thing. The aim right now is to choose something that will initially teach me to throw a good, hard punch. Hopefully whatever I go for, paired with some good old cardio and strength training will result in a fitness level where I can sprint the fuck away!

New alternative South/SW London music scene.,"This is a shameless plug and also a very genuine attempt to change the face of music in South to South West London.

Saw it in the underground station either at Balham or Stockwell, can’t remember exactly.

Your feelings about the next 5 years,"Short background. Mrs is from London, I lived there for 10 years (grew up in Kent), we both lived in continental Europe and then for 7 years have lived in Sweden. We also have EU citizenship. I want to come back to London and we're considering 2027 as that is when her business in Stockholm will close and she will sell up. Our choice is London, Stockholm (where she needs to start a new business) or somewhere else. We're quite tired of moving and will be 40 by the time she sells her business. I work in tech so I can live anywhere in theory.

She's fluent in Italian however the job market there and the difficulties for foringers make it unlikely. Any other country that doesn't use English as a primary language she will find really difficult and she had a really brutal 3 years in Sweden finding work (hence she has her own business as that was easier). She is concerned about moving back to London. I have very amazing memories of it in my 20s, it is the best place I've ever lived by a very long way. My other half careers now is in events and hospitality, is is MD for a hospitality business in Stockholm and so local language is very important. We get away with this in Stockholm, but, Spain for example, I am unsure if we would.

The UK is a shocker right now, but I do have some hope with the tories being kicked out. Not loads but some. How do you lads and ladies in the group feel about it? What's the feeling in the air of the next few years? We're getting married in London this year, and we go back at least once or twice a year and I always find it difficult to come back to Stockholm, but a holiday is not real life so I wanted to hear from Londoners how they felt.

We don't have kids nor ever will.

Edit. Just to add from some comments here. It's really easy to say ""go somewhere warm"" but basically my other half needs to work in English and even if I earn so much she didn't have to work (which won't happen), she will want to work and do something with her life. So saying ""let's go to Spain"" is a lot more difficult when you think how will she work unless she does an intensive language course and she's on both sides of the fence on that one.

I need to point as well that we have lived in 4 countries and we always did love living in London. I know to some this will seam crazy but that is what life is like for us.

"Samuel Jones & Co, paper making factory in Camberwell","Hello everyone,

I'm currently working on a university project focusing on the history of Samuel Jones & Co LTD, a paper maker factory that operated in Camberwell from 1810 until it was demolished in 1982.

Situated on Southampton Way, this factory was once a significant part of the community, known for adopting the Camberwell Beauty Butterfly as its emblem. Interestingly, the mosaic of this butterfly that adorned the main building has been preserved and relocated to Wells Way.

The factory was renowned for producing gum paper and for hosting various sporting events and occasional galas. It's possible that locals referred to it as the ""Butterfly Factory.""

I'm reaching out to gather any insights or memories from those who lived in Camberwell during the factory's active years. How noticeable was the factory's presence? What do you remember about its size and activities? Any input would be greatly appreciated!

Ways for 60s-70s to make friends in London ,"So my mum (70 years old but still super active) has just moved back to London (Clapham) after living abroad for just over 5 years and no one she used to know here is still around.

I know she’s looked at meet up things and walking clubs but it seems when she’s gone people have either been in their 40s (so she feels too old) or it’s been people her age/ a bit older but who aren’t quite as active and can’t keep up.

The main difference between NYC and London,"I’ve lived in NYC for 10 years and now back in London.

I can tell you what makes NYC unique. I want to end it by also saying why I still think London is better but I likely won’t have time as I’m meeting friends in 20 minutes for brunch so please restrain your pitchforks till I get a chance to update this later today.

Anyway the big difference is that in London, zone 1 is soo expensive few ordinary mortals can afford to live there. Instead the pattern for a typical Londoner that’s been in the city for more than a year or two is Work in Zone 1, Play in zone 2, live in zone 3+

With NYC, the equivalent of zone 1 is Manhattan below 110th st. (really tempted to say below 59th st but a whole swathe of New Yorkers would be mortally offended :-)

It’s very normal for your average professional to live in Manhattan, whether it be through apartment sharing or living by themselves.

As a result there’s more foot traffic at all hours of the day for all types of businesses to succeed, and as a result you live, work, and play in the equivalent of zone 1. 

This is what gives NYC its energy, and makes it both exhilarating and exhausting.

Part II

Thanks for all the comments below. Was interesting to read. Now I’ll move onto why I prefer London.

London is much more a long term place to live than NYC. Part of the problem with a lot more people being crammed into the centre is that buying property is super expensive.. particularly service charge. I was looking to buy in NYC and the building service charge cost the same as if I had chosen to rent out the place!

So then you think, ok sure let’s just move out to Brooklyn  or Queens - the equivalent to moving out to zones 2-5 in London. Well guess what, zones 2-5 in London is def prettier than most of Brooklyn and queens with the except of a few places like dumbo. 

So at that point you may as well be in London.

But that’s not all. Thanks to the historical architecture and beautiful parks, London is a far more pleasant city to walk around in. The hustle and bustle of NYC, and the constant honking of horns (believe me, London is far quieter in this regards), make living in NYC quite stressful. 

Once you start from the premise of not wanting to live in the centre, London feels like a much more pleasant, cleaner, and greener city than NYC.","The main difference between NYC and London I’ve lived in NYC for 10 years and now back in London.

Best day to visit Portobello Market?,"Hello all,

Me and my s.o. will be visiting London for the first time in late April for a week. Our plan is to venture out to Notting Hill and potentially get some vintage goodies from Portobello Market on a Thursday. However, I’ve been seeing online that the market itself is open all week, but some others are saying the best day to go is either Friday/Saturday for vintage goods. Yet, we’d also like to avoid the busy days, but if we have to endure it we’ll settle for the weekend.

Any thoughts or opinions on whether we should stick to our plan or change our trip to Notting Hill for Friday/Saturday? Thank you!

Edit: Thank you to those who commented advice, we’ve changed our date to visit the market and even made some reservations for lunch/dinner around that area! Appreciate it! ","Best day to visit Portobello Market? Hello all,

However, I’ve been seeing online that the market itself is open all week, but some others are saying the best day to go is either Friday/Saturday for vintage goods. Yet, we’d also like to avoid the busy days, but if we have to endure it we’ll settle for the weekend.

Any thoughts or opinions on whether we should stick to our plan or change our trip to Notting Hill for Friday/Saturday? Thank you!

Edit: Thank you to those who commented advice, we’ve changed our date to visit the market and even made some reservations for lunch/dinner around that area! Appreciate it! ",Top-Field569,6,0.71,3,2024-02-16 20:36:22,London

Older American visitors looking for petite women's shopping places in London.,"Greetings!  My wife and I have never been to London (well, I've never been there, she briefly was there after college on a whirlwind tour).  We are visiting in the second half of April, staying at my cousin's place in London (Fulham).  We will just be walking around or taking the tube or buses.  I'd like to take my wife to some women's clothing stores that especially deal in petite sizes.  

I got her a dress once from Boden's that she likes, and I see there's a Boden's outlet store but it seems a bit out of the way (based on where we are staying) and I don't know if it's worth the trip.   We certainly plan to visit Harrod's but any other suggestions/corrections are welcome.","Older American visitors looking for petite women's shopping places in London. Greetings!

Trying to develop a late night comedy scene in London,"Comedy is booming worldwide and especially in London, however there is one major drawback of this fine city of ours. Due to alcohol licensing restricting sales after 11 pm in most venues, all comedy shows finish early during the week. This makes it difficult for us comedians to test new material compared to somewhere like LA or New York, where new material gigs run into the wee small hours. 

A few of us have banded together and are trying to develop a late night comedy scene. There are a few ideas on the boil. The most obvious one is to find venues with a late license. Another one is to hold BYOB shows in non-drinks serving locations, e.g. cafes, community centres, etc. Of course, these need to be near public transport. 

I post this because I am a comedy nerd and hopefully others find it interesting. Also, if you run or have any suggestions of venues with late licenses and a stage or sound system, please jump into my DMs.

Finally, and not the entire purpose of this post but at least 51% of the motive, if you're interested in catching some late night new material, we do have a gig on Feb 19th. Entry is free, and we will actually be making a loss on equipment etc., so I hope this isn't caught as spam. We just think it's worth doing to try to bring something new to the London scene. It'll be a bunch of pro and semi pro comics testing new material after the comedy clubs have finished, but they need an audience to tell them if their shit works or not. Please do come down, it's at a pub called The Brunel in Rotherhithe at 10.30 pm, and there's apparently discounts on selected pints all night so happy days...","Trying to develop a late night comedy scene in London Comedy is booming worldwide and especially in London, however there is one major drawback of this fine city of ours.

GOT CAUGHT USING 11-15 OYSTER. HELP!!,"Currently the Feb half term, got caught using my siblings oyster 11-15 (Im 19, gap year & unemployed). The reason I did this is as I don’t personally have one as Im not eligible for a student one as im not at an institution yet and needed to go to the hospital. It was just a rash decision as I have also been scammed for 1.2k which is currently being investigated by my bank hence I didnt think of paying using my card. I also suffer from stress, anxiety and depression (Dr notes to prove this). The tfl guy took my details said a letter will be sent to me and I have the chance to appeal it and its up to them what they will do. Ive heard of people get court cases / have to pay fares or do community service. My sibling is 12 and had no knowledge of this. 

I really want to avoid the court case as I want to study a healthcare course at uni next year. Does anyone have any advice i would really appreciate as I am panicking. 
I am unemployed and am thinking to send my Dr notes to prove my issues with mental health, proof from my bank that I have been scammed… anything else I can do to make my case strong?

What the fuck is this housing standard?,"I’m not looking to move out of my current flat. Yet. But I will be at some point, so today, influenced by a discussion about the future which I had with my husband, I checked the flats in our most desired living area. Then in our second most desired area. And then in our current area, which is not bad at all. 

Which leads me to ask, what the fuck is this housing standard? Kitchenettes instead of kitchens, kitchens which are completely non functional with no worktops and covered in white tiles. I don’t care that they have a stupid cool-looking SMEG fridge. Give. Me. Cooking space. Oddly elongated rooms, plastic chairs at the dining table, toilets with exposed pipes looking like they are about to get clogged and burst, depressingly small windows, carpets EVERY-fucking-WHERE or alternatively, fake wood panels looking like someone threw up all over them and forgot to clean it up. Bedrooms just big enough to fit in a bed that will kind of be enough for two people, with no storage space, barely any natural lighting, OF COURSE covered in carpet. Second bedrooms half that size. Windows looking out at staircases and pavements so that I will either get no light all year round or curious tourists looking into my flat. All that for only £4k/month. 

Or you can live in a soulless Canary Wharf development instead. Where shit is also ugly and also breaks down constantly because it’s built for renters so who gives a fuck. 

Rant over. 

Yes, I have lived in London for a while. Yes, I am aware of the housing problems. But even being ready to pay more than average doesn’t get you a nice flat anymore. 

Edit to add: I forgot my favourite thing - single glazed windows or double glazed windows which don’t seal properly because there is, in fact, no seal in the windows’ construction. So condensation on window panes all through the winter. ","What the fuck is this housing standard? I’m not looking to move out of my current flat. Yet.

Windows looking out at staircases and pavements so that I will either get no light all year round or curious tourists looking into my flat. All that for only £4k/month. 

Or you can live in a soulless Canary Wharf development instead. Where shit is also ugly and also breaks down constantly because it’s built for renters so who gives a fuck. 

Rant over. 

Yes, I have lived in London for a while. Yes, I am aware of the housing problems. But even being ready to pay more than average doesn’t get you a nice flat anymore. 

Edit to add: I forgot my favourite thing - single glazed windows or double glazed windows which don’t seal properly because there is, in fact, no seal in the windows’ construction. So condensation on window panes all through the winter. ",letskilleachother,171,0.78,140,2024-02-15 23:11:13,London

Wedding Outfit Shopping Recs,"Hi all! I'm going to a wedding next month and want a fabulous dress. I've looked online and nothing is catching my eye. There's no dress code, but I want something that's not too young (read cheap) looking nor too dowdy (I'm young ish). Guests will be going all out and I want to do the same. Budget flexible, but hoping under £300. I'm thinking of venturing into 'town' tomorrow to pound the streets, but can anyone tell me of there are any highstreet stores even worth checking out anymore? Maybe I need a shop that's good for cocktail dresses or something? I'm a size 14-16 so I need somewhere that's not just for waifs.

"Lonely people, what do you do on a Friday evening when you really don't want to be home?","Married for 10 years but things not going well, living like roommates for a while now. After a Valentine's day that went completely unacknowledged (despite me bringing some Chinese takeaway that we ate separately), I just can't stand the tought of being home tomorrow evening.

I'm already going to the office but things are not particularly busy, and even if they were, working late wouldn't probably cheer me up.

So my question to you dear lonely Londoners, what is there to do to pass the time and get distracted, between 5pm and let's say 9pm? No friends to speak of, don't really drink much and not a big foodie either. Are there any museums that would open late tomorrow? Ideas of shows or street exhibitions/markets? Bonus points if it's not too expensive so I won't feel worse if I don't enjoy it!!

(And before you tell me to just leave, it's really not that easy and I'd like to think we're not there yet.)","Lonely people, what do you do on a Friday evening when you really don't want to be home?

"LIDL Finsbury Park, WTF?","Second time this has happened to me in the last 12 months.

Sometimes, I just pop into a supermarket to pick up a few bits and bobs. The stock change at LIDL isn't consistent so occasionally I walk around, don't find what I'm looking for, and then leave.

Now the layout is such that the tills are a longer walk than just skipping over the entrance to the doorway right in front, which is what I do. You're supposed to walk the long way around if you're leaving. Most of the time, I'm not bothered by the security standing right there. But sometimes I am. And this time, this one actually lays hands on me.

I always argue, because I am doing nothing wrong at all. Just an over-zealous security worker who thinks that the uniform gives them powers of arrest. The 'crime' I've committed is going the wrong way around the supermarket. I let them know that the uniform has gotten to their heads and although it looks like a police uniform, they're not actually a police officer. They mutter something under their breath and I get on with my day.

I'm in my 50's, 6ft male, I won't be bullied like an 18 year old. So I don't let it get to me, but I find it disturbing that people will act on something so trivial. I've dealt with a fair few egotistical bouncers in my day, this feels just like the same thing.","LIDL Finsbury Park, WTF? Second time this has happened to me in the last 12 months.

Bubala London - Wow,"As a man who eats meat I’ve spent the last 20 years of my life in long term relationships with vegetarians. A special night out has always being dictated by vegetarianism but my word this was the first time it’s been spectacular 

Quite hard to get a table but took my partner to Bubala today.

Daughter was in nursery so took advantage.

We’ve been together for ten years but I normally try and go veggie as she is.

I’ve never enjoyed a vegetarian meal so much. £40 each and the table was loaded from the start with unlimited freshly cooked and seasoned flat breads.

Every plate came out was outstanding and as a meat eater I didn’t even feel like I was missing out.

Get a table if you can. The house wine was even immense

Only dubious part was the deconstructed baklava","Bubala London - Wow As a man who eats meat I’ve spent the last 20 years of my life in long term relationships with vegetarians.

Generation Rent; what’s the plan?,"With the recent talk of planning reforms and the numbers of younger people unable to get on the housing ladder, it got me thinking; what is the end game?

Moving out of London is an option that I often hear people throw out there, but not always possible due to work or family commitments. And if people do leave, what kind of impact will this have on the city? I think it’s already being felt in the inner city with reduced numbers of kids in classrooms as families move further out if not leave the city all together.

If people are unable to buy and therefore stuck renting privately, what happens when they can no longer work and therefore afford their rent? Even if they’ve managed to accumulate some savings, that’ll only go so far.

Other than house building on a massive scale, not sure what else will make a dent. I know it’s not going to be converting the old corner shop into flats.","Generation Rent; what’s the plan?

Barriers in Stratford Station,"Hi all,

Wondering if anyone could help me out please?

My boyfriend and I are headed to a concert tonight and he bought us the London Evening Out tickets instead of the London Night Out ones. The concert is at the O2, our tickets are for Lvpl St (options are for either Lvpl St or Stratford). They are classed as advance tickets. 

We are worried about the amount of time after the concert to actually get back to Lvpl St to catch our train so were wondering if we could just get the Jubilee Line to Stratford and then get our train home from there? 

I can’t see anything on the T&Cs regarding this so does anyone have any experience with this or any knowledge on whether the Jubilee Line exit and Greater Anglia platforms (9+10 i think) have any barriers between them?

Where can I go in London to remember my Dad?,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is the right thread for this. My dad passed away suddenly 18 months ago and his birthday is coming up soon, the 2nd one without him. The first one I couldn’t get out of bed, but this time I want to do something to remember him. He lived abroad and that’s where the funeral was and his ashes are, so I don’t have any form of grave/headstone/memorial I can visit. He never lived in London and rarely ever came so it’s not like I have anywhere that was special to him that I can go. What I’d like to do is go somewhere peaceful to remember him, maybe a nice walk or to some nice gardens, or if anyone knows of an activity that would be suitable. Not somewhere that would be overly touristy (hard for London I know) as it falls on a weekend. He wasn’t religious and neither am I so I think that rules out churches for me, but still open to suggestions. I live in South West London but I’d be happy to go anywhere, or even out of London on a day trip somewhere. I just want somewhere to go to remember him for a short while.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone for your kind and helpful responses. I think I’m going to look into either St. Dunstan in the East and a walk along the Thames, Kyoto Gardens in Holland Park, or Kew Gardens to see the redwoods.

London's rhythm,"I often find myself questioning the urgency in my daily pursuits, only to realise I'm headed back home. This city I love has woven the hustle culture into my very being.

It feels like a relentless competition to embody a universal persona. I gaze into the mirror, contemplating if I've unwittingly conformed.

Individuality, though ostensibly praised, seems confined to fleeting trends and appearances. People champion your success but recoil at the thought of you surpassing them.

I read online I can buy Yen at the post office but they don’t say if I can buy a minimum amount Like 1000 yen which would be 5£ something and it’s the smallest note.

London Assembly calls for restored TfL bus link between Waltham Abbey and Chingford,"The London Assembly notes that not a single bus service is provided between Waltham Abbey and neighbouring Chingford.

Because of this, it is today calling on Transport for London (TfL) to restore a frequent, daily bus link between Waltham Abbey and Chingford either by extending route 215, route 379 or both, to at least Waltham Abbey Town Centre.

Emma Best AM, who proposed the motion, said:

“I’m delighted my Assembly colleagues agreed today to support our motion calling on TfL to restore frequent, daily buses between Waltham Abbey and Chingford. This can be achieved by extending bus route 215 or 379.

“There is currently no bus service Waltham Abbey and Chingford. This route previously ran every day with buses every 10 to 30 minutes from early mornings to late evenings. We need this level of service restored.”

The full text of the motion is:

The 505 bus, running between Chingford and Harlow, is no longer in service.

In May 2015, the bus operator Arriva handed responsibility for the route over to TrustyBus, reducing the service to just six buses a day.

The stretch between Waltham Abbey and Chingford was once frequently served 7 days a week by London bus route 242, with buses every 10 to 30 minutes from early mornings to late evenings. On a Sunday, the final bus from Chingford Station to Waltham Abbey would leave as late as 00:10.

Now, not a single bus provides a service between Waltham Abbey and Chingford. All bus stops on Sewardstone Road towards Chingford (except the Lea Valley Camp Site) are completely unserved.

This Assembly calls on Transport for London to restore a frequent, daily London Buses link between Waltham Abbey and neighbouring Chingford by extending route 215 (which currently terminates at the Lea Valley Camp Site on Sewardstone Road – just within the Waltham Abbey boundary), route 379 (which also terminates on Sewardstone Road), or both, to at least Waltham Abbey Town Centre.","London Assembly calls for restored TfL bus link between Waltham Abbey and Chingford The London Assembly notes that not a single bus service is provided between Waltham Abbey and neighbouring Chingford.

How do people start renting in London if they haven’t moved there yet?,"I’m applying to jobs in London at the moment and I’m caught up in looking at the (very depressing) rental prices. One thing I have noticed though is that you’re supposed to physically view the property before you move in, which I don’t understand how you would do if you live elsewhere (I’m currently in Scotland doing my master’s). 

A lot of the ‘advice’ seems to completely disregard people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Not only do I not have friends or family member’s place to stay at because I’m originally from the North and don’t know anyone in London that would be willing to let me sofa surf, I also can’t afford to pay London air B&B rates and also put down a deposit for a flat and move all my stuff again. How do people do it? 

I also won’t have a guarantor as because I’m estranged from my family, but even if I wasn’t they wouldn’t qualify to provide as guarantors because they don’t work. How do people get around this, too?  

I’m not even sure if I’m moving yet but it’s keeping me up with worry, any info or personal experience would be appreciated!

EDIT:

Thank you for all your responses, I think I have a better idea as to what to expect now but I’ll go over some points:

- Despite doing my undergraduate in London, I do not have any friends there. Yes, I know this is tragic, but I can’t change the past. I’ve learnt my lesson and have friends at my current university, but the job market isn’t exactly thriving in Fife… 

- Money isn’t technically the issue, as my university will help pay for things such as travel if needed due to my estranged status. I think I overestimated how much a deposit was (I thought I was like 2k or something). I’m more confused about the logistics.

- I would *NEVER* move back to London without a secure job that pays well, I know it isn’t worth it. 

- I think the best course of action is to visit for a week-ish a few weeks before I’m due to move and do nothing but flat hunt. I should earn enough to rent a studio in zone 2/3/4, and I know what neighbourhoods I like and don’t like from my undergrad which should make the process easier. I also don’t have a life (also known as drinking in this country) so money for ‘going out’ isn’t really a concern. 

Again, thank you for all the advice so far, I know moving to London is a risk but it is the best place to start a career in my field.

[Resident Advisor:](https://ra.co/events/uk/london) Focusing on mainly electronic music and clubbing but you can also find a great variety of music events in here. Also have this installed on your phone all the time.

[Design My Night:](https://www.designmynight.com/london) Curated lists, club nights and other useful stuff.

It\`s the Valentine\`s Day Week and by the frequency of \`How do I find a partner in London???\` threads, we all are single. Which is fine, we\`ll get there eventually. Keep working, go outside, talk to people, go to places you haven\`t been before, it\`ll happen eventually

Let\`s start with the big events this week:

[BIG BALKAN BASH W/ SHANTEL (DJ), TANTZ + MORE @ Hootannay Brixton (16/02)](https://hootanannybrixton.co.uk/bigbalkanbash-shantel/): The Big Balkan Bash is back and this time with the amazing Shantel! Unfortunately it\`s not Shantel and Bucovina Orchestra which is an INSANE event but for some reason he never brings the band here.

Anyway, The Big Balkan Bash is now five (four?) year old event happens at Hoots. You will listen lots of amazing high energy Balkan music, everyone dances like mad people and you get to see people take off their shirts and yell in Serbian. 

Shantel is an amazing DJ / performer (he sings some of his very popular songs and classics from Goran Bregovic or Gogol Bordello) and Tantz is also an amazing live band.

I will be 100% attending this, **GO TO THIS EVENT IF YOU DON\`T HAVE ANY OTHER PLANS!** 

Also, remember Hoots is **FREE ENTRY BEFORE 9 P.M.**

Speaking of Hoots, damn they STACKED gigs this week:

[Disco in a Str!p Club (with Dancers) @ Metropolis Club (17/02):](https://ra.co/events/1827809) Metropolis is pushing some new events to enhance already amazing classic club nights on Saturdays

For the uninitiated, Metropolis is a three storey strip club that turns into a regular club (without the strippers) ONLY on Saturdays. **Tickets are £6 advance** which is considered free in this economic hell scape we are in.

>Some very special friends of ours will be turning up the notch...  Every Saturday we breathe disco into our iconic East London str!p club, creating five floors of adventure where everyone is welcome.  Serving house and disco heaters until 4am, our residents supply high-energy revelry all night.  We invite you to get loose at East London’s naughtiest late-night party.  For the fabulous. For the indulgent. £5 Tickets. 

This club night is very LGBTQI+ friendly as well, not a gay club but very open and inclusive.

Get early drinks is either at **Coupette or Netil 360** and show up early. The rooftop is also where you eventually get asked if you have a spare cigarette so make it count if you fancy them

Yes, yes I know Shoreditch is a dumpster now and we all are way too good to be there anymore, getting shoulder to shoulder with Deanos spilling from the sewer grate called Liverpool Street Station (do I need to put a /s at the end here?)

Anyway, jokes aside, SupaDupaFly is one of the oldest HipHop and R&B Club Nights in the City. They also host more contemporary HipHop nights but that\`s like not my jam at all. 

>Expect to hear 90s & 00s R&B from Aaliyah, TLC, Missy, Brandy, Kelis, Usher, Destiny's Child, SWV J.T & loads more good stuff. 90s & 00s hip-hop from 2Pac, Biggie, Lil Kim, DMX, Jay-Z, Busta, Kanye, The Neptunes, Nas & Ludacris from the best to do it!

Unfortunately it\`s not Shantel and Bucovina Orchestra which is an INSANE event but for some reason he never brings the band here.

Anyway, The Big Balkan Bash is now five (four?) year old event happens at Hoots. You will listen lots of amazing high energy Balkan music, everyone dances like mad people and you get to see people take off their shirts and yell in Serbian. 

Shantel is an amazing DJ / performer (he sings some of his very popular songs and classics from Goran Bregovic or Gogol Bordello) and Tantz is also an amazing live band.

I will be 100% attending this, **GO TO THIS EVENT IF YOU DON\`T HAVE ANY OTHER PLANS!**

How to identify an Uber?,"Hi all, I lost my phone in an UberXL on Thursday night. Since this, the location of the phone has been moving around, then stationery at night, at an address in west London.  I think it has fallen between the seats and the driver is unaware that it is in his vehicle.

Since this, the location of the phone has been moving around, then stationery at night, at an address in west London.  I think it has fallen between the seats and the driver is unaware that it is in his vehicle.

Rental Prices Dropping In London,"It's probably too early to get excited, but I can't be the only one seeing this, right? Lately, places on Rightmove that seemed stuck at absurd prices suddenly have reductions. Even saw something about it in a rental report.

[https://homelet.co.uk/homelet-rental-index](https://homelet.co.uk/homelet-rental-index)

Listen, we all know London ain't cheap. But I get this nagging feeling...

* Did landlords realize they might've pushed their luck a bit too far?
* Is this that moment rents can't get higher because nobody is left to rip off?
* Could refusing those insane prices actually do something, even on a small scale?

I'm no housing expert, and don't want to give false hope. But after feeling helpless for so long, this  almost feels like a tiny win. Is this just me, or are others seeing a slight shift?

Parking scheme consultation - how to?,"Morning all,

Our local council informed us of an open “consultation” on some proposed changes to parking arrangements on our road (and a few others). For context, we live on an ex-council estate (1950s) with very broad roads and junctions, away from the main road and traffic.

There are currently no road markings, so parking is extremely relaxed (lucky, I know). Pretty much everyone is guaranteed one or two parking spaces in front of their house and if we were all to have visit, those cars could easily park too. Parking galore, basically!

Visibility is good and even with cars parked on both sides (doesn’t normally happen, people happily stick to one side), the few cars that use the road (mainly residents and the odd post office van/skip lorry/trades person) can easily pass, there hasn’t been any blockage or traffic on these roads.

I’m afraid the council is only doing this to make more money from either permits or enforced parking spots, despite there being no good justification for it. If this was a problem area, where parking is being abused, I’d understand, but it really is the best setup possible and I can’t help but feel this is done out of spite. Why should we not have the same costs/stress/problems the rest of the UK has?

My question is, how does one respond to such a consultation (what language to use, how to structure) and what are legal/valid reasons to oppose this? Any other advice you can provide?

Thanks!","Parking scheme consultation - how to? Morning all,

#[the r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index)

It includes sections on:

**What should I see and where are the non-touristy stuff and hidden gems?**  
We've written about the big must-sees [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/thingstosee) and we highly recommend [TfL's Experiences site](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london).   
We've listed some of our favourite lesser-known stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/secretlondon)
And the cheap/free stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/lowbudget)

**How do I pay for the Tube/bus, and what's an Oyster card?**    
You don't pay cash.  You can use a number of contactless payments systems such as your Contactless bankcard (which is widespread in the UK, but maybe not so much elsewhere), Apple Pay, Android Pay, or you can buy an Oyster card and top it up with credit.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) for more.

**How do I get from this place to that place?**  
Use [Citymapper](http://citymapper.com).  Honestly, we're not shills for them; it's just a really good app and is used by most of the locals on this sub.  

**Is x area safe?**  
Yes. Bad stuff can happen in any large city, but London is generally very safe.  There aren't any no-go zones.  Even under the shadow of terrorist attacks, most Londoners feel safe.  See [our safety page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/safety) for more.

**Tips for posting:**

**Tell us about you** - If you want us to suggest things for you to do then you need to give us a good idea of what you enjoy. Don't just say ""I like music"", say what type of music. Don't just say you want ""somewhere nice to eat"", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki.

**Tell us your budget** - If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something ""cheap"" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective.

**Tell us where you'll be based** - Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations.

**Asking about hotels or hostels** - We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say ""I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?"" then that's the sort of thing we can answer.

**Non-touristy stuff** - There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki).

Soft racism in UK/London?,"Hi I’m an ethic Chinese person who grew up in New Zealand who has just moved to London and I’m finding quite a few cases of ‘soft segregation’? Not sure quite how to describe it. I’m just wondering if anyone POC or Asian has found a similar experience moving here.

For example finding a flat, or heck even making friends at social events/bumble/meetups I have found it quite hard to connect with anyone that’s not POC. Not to say anything bad, but it’s just quite shocking as I feel like I feel the racial divide a lot more here than back in NZ despite London having more people and being more multicultural on the face of things. 

Like when finding a flat, or even the behaviour towards me finding a job, or even booking an Airbnb. I have felt a lot more Asian in Europe/UK than I have at home. Is this just after COVID and people being very anti-immigrant or something else? I feel like more people means that each culture tends to group around each other i.e asians with other asians or white people with other white people…it just feels so weird - like there’s this invisible force where I’m being pushed into a niche or into a category I can’t control just because of the colour of my skin.  Maybe I’m just overthinking it. ","Soft racism in UK/London?

Found a note in Hampstead Heath,"EDIT: I accidentally wrote mother instead of grandmother.

Today at Hampstead Heath, I found the most perfect little note. It was rolled up and slotted into the posts of the black viewing benches on the pitch 11/sports field, just up from Limes Ave. 
It was anonymous (besides the date being written the American way) and I won’t go into any details here. But, in the note, the author said that they had left one there maybe 15 years ago, they wondered if anyone had read them. 
Here to say I read this one, dated 2/8/24 (it hurt to type that.) I wanted to say thank you. I really needed that today, I hope your grandmother is doing as well as she can. 

I’m getting evicted, there’s many things in my life I’m unsure of at the moment - your message of letting go, and the insistence that the path is none of my fucking business, and to just keep walking it, really shifted something in me today. I hope one day you can read this and know it did something. Keep spreading the love!

(The note typed out below, I have also posted images in r/foundpaper ) 

Heaven in the Heath

To whom it may concern, 
I’m here in this beautiful sheltered heavenly spot on the heath, visiting my 94 year old grandmother who may be in her last days of an extraordinary life. 
Didn’t have much planned for this trip other than being by her side and hoping that I may get a moment to revisit this favourite hideaway in one of my favourite pieces of nature in this world. 
It must have been 15-20 years ago that I was a single man in my 20s and I wondered when I would settle down and have my own family. 
Suddenly, while writing in a journal at the time, there was this torrential rain that surrounded me, yet I was protected by this old bench with a marvellous view. I wrote a note in my journal about that moment and how I longed for love, and even mentioned that I had loved Foreigner’s hit “I wanna know what love is.” It feels incredibly on the nose, but something about the warm synths and epic chorus felt appropriate in that moment.
Now I’m here again, the note is not here. I wonder if anyone ever read it. 
Now, I’m married with 3 kids and I still have a lot to figure out but I couldn’t be happier to be on the other side. 
There is one thing I can say for sure. All the things including love were going to happen to me regardless of what I said or did. As long as I was open, it was all part of the plan. I need to remind myself that especially as I get older, I have to release control from my life. Operate from my heart and let the results take care of themselves. The path is none of my damn business, but the intention is my responsibility. Best of luck with whatever is confronting you. I believe in you!! LOVE!!

Just feels like there are less and less cheap things to do. We’ve done exhibition road, we’ve seen street performers, transport museum etc. Only thing we haven’t done is markets because they’re disinterested in that and will get cranky and start arguing each other.

Will I pay a penalty fare / fine?,"I took the Southeastern Railway today and bought a mobile ticket to Stratford International. I mistakenly missed the stop and got off at St. Pancras International - didn’t think it would be a problem.

When trying to tap out, my mobile rail ticket did not work. To be fair, there were several people who had rail tickets not working and someone told me to just tap my credit card. I didn’t give much thought about it at the time because I knew I would be entering the Underground.

Then, I went to the Underground - tapped in and out with contactless as usual.

It’s only now - especially with the contactless tap out at St Pancras and then the immediate tap in to go to the Underground - that I’m worried I’d be charged a penalty fare.

I am not from here and this was my first UK rail journey so I was quite confused. I recognize that I went an extra stop, but in the absence of any ticket checks nor taps ins or outs on my earlier (separate) rail journey that day, I didn’t think much of it. The station staff literally said just get on the train and the gates/turnstiles were wide open.

Can anyone best advise me how to proceed? Should I expect a penalty fare? Please I hope not I think they can be hundreds of pounds

Financial checks on council housing in London,"Hi All,

Do they carry out financial checks periodically to see if people still require financial assistance?

TFL are absolutely ridiculous.,This is going to be long. I recently travelled from Hayes all the way to Telford via train. I bought tickets initially from reading as I thought I’d be getting dropped there but due to some car trouble I had to get to reading via train. At the station it’s stated you have to have a ticket after reading which seemed fine as my ticket is from reading so I tapped my debit card at the barrier. As I got to the station in reading I got stopped by workers and they wrote me up as they thought i was shorting my trip and paying less than I need to which i understand it can come across like that but I showed them that I did pay but silly man still decided to write me up and said you can send your bank statement to show that you did pay. I sent tfl every bit of evidence showing my tickets and the bank statements to show I’ve paid and they just end up replying with. The bank statement shows no activity of this and it literally does. What else can I do from this point?,TFL are absolutely ridiculous. This is going to be long. I recently travelled from Hayes all the way to Telford via train.

Third space gym membership?,"I am considering a third space membership as I love swimming and spa time and I am fond of Pilates reformer classes (that are often 28£ a go in London… )

The Mayfair branch offers reformer within the membership, plus pool, sauna and access to all third space gyms. As I work in central this seems to fit for me. (With soho and Marylebone close too)

But I am questioning if the 280£pm membership costs are out of my budget? 

I earn ~70-75k a year.  I own my flat with a mortgage of around 870£ pm. Single, no dependents.

Are there others members or sensible money people who can advise if that kind of expense is viable on my salary? :/
And if any people with experience of the gym can recommend and believe it’s worth the cost do let me know :)","Third space gym membership? I am considering a third space membership as I love swimming and spa time and I am fond of Pilates reformer classes (that are often 28£ a go in London… )

Anyone needs programming / computer science lessons?,"Hi all,

Please remove this post if it is not allowed here. Hope you are having a good weekend. I am a PhD student in Computer Science (in compilers and programming languages). I will have some extra time starting March and can teach programming languages like: python, C/C++.Rust.   


I can also help in developing self-projects or preparing for tech companies interviews (I have worked with companies like Goldman Sachs and got selected in competitive programs like Google's open source program and companie sponsored hackathons).

Besides, I really enjoy helping people learn and understand beauty of computer science. I am mostly looking to give online lessons but in-person sometimes is also possible (depending upon if it is needed).
